# Week 1

Refer to [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/weeks/1/) for the courswork video, lecture notes and problem set.

This week's problem set makes use of what you've learnt about the programming language C. I've realised that it is not an easy language
to learn.

Do follow the instructions on [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/1/).

You hae to submit a minimum of 3 compulsory problems that you must submit, Hello, Mario and Cash/Credit. Alterantively, 
you can challenge yourself to all 5 problems.

I've uploaded all 5 of them. They seem to work, but I doubt they are the best solutions.
