# CS50
My repository of my works for the CS50x 2020 course by HarvardX.

For more info on the CS50 OpenCourseWare, visit [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/).

For more info on the CS50 edx course, visit [here](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/)

I would be putting my solutions to the coursework here, according to the weeks. I do not have the best of solutions, but feel free to make use of it as reference. However, do note of [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/syllabus/#academic-honesty).

Its my first time on GitHub as well, so forgive me if things are a little messy. I'm still learning!
Drop me a note if you have advice and recommendations to make!
