# Week 0

Refer to [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/weeks/0/) for the courswork video, lecture notes and problem set.

This week's problem set requires the use of [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), an online platform that uses drag-and-drop code blocks
to generate your own mini programs.

Do follow the instructions and specifications on [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/0/).

I've decided to make a multiplayer pong game. Its not completed yet, but you can find it [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/384586024/).

I've also uploaded the .sb3 file for recording purposes.
